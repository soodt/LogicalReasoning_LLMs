A and B are different colors.\n2. A can be either Red or Blue.\n3. B can be either Red or Blue.\n4. If A is Red, then B must be Blue, and if A is Blue, then B must be Red.\n\nThese constraints should be enough to uniquely determine the colors of the houses based on the information provided in the puzzle.",
