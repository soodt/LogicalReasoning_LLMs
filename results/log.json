In this case, we have two variables: one for the color of the house where Person A lives (let's call it A) and another for the color of the house where Person B lives (let's call it B).\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the problem:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"declare_sorts\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"HouseColor\",\n      \"elements\": [\"Red\", \"Blue\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"declare_funs\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"A\",\n      \"sort\": \"HouseColor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"B\",\n      \"sort\": \"HouseColor\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"assert\": [\n    \"A != B\",\n    \"exists(x, (x = 'Red' -> A = x) || (x = 'Blue' -> A = x))\",\n    \"exists(x, (x = 'Red' -> B = x) || (x = 'Blue' -> B = x))\",\n    \"if(A = 'Red', then B = 'Blue', B = 'Red')\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON represents the following constraints:\n\n1. A and B are different colors.\n2. A can be either Red or Blue.\n3. B can be either Red or Blue.\n4. If A is Red, then B must be Blue, and if A is Blue, then B must be Red.\n\nThese constraints should be enough to uniquely determine the colors of the houses based on the information provided in the puzzle.",
